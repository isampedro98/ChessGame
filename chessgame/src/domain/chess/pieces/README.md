# Pieces

- `SlidingPiece.ts`: shared utilities for pieces that move along rays (rook, bishop, queen).
- `King.ts`, `Queen.ts`, `Rook.ts`, `Bishop.ts`, `Knight.ts`, `Pawn.ts`: concrete pieces with move generation and cloning behaviour.
- `index.ts`: exports every piece class from a single entry point.
